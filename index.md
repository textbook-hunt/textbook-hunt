# About 
Textbook-Hunt is a meteor application providing a UH student with a market of used textbooks. When you arrive at the site the first thing you meet is the landing page. 

A UH student can log in with their UH account and create a profile in which they can be either the seller or consumer. 

As a seller, you can list the different textbooks you are selling by listing the following: name of the textbook, classes that require the book, conditions of the book (Excellent, Good, Okay), price, and additional comments to the book. 

As a consumer, you can search by textbook name or class. Textbook-Hunt will provide a filter page that will display the different textbooks based off the class and name.
