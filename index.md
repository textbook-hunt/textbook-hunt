# Textbook Hunt

## Goal of the Project 

Textbook-Hunt provides college students with cheaper alternatives for textbooks and for students to sell unneeded textbooks for additional pocket money. 

## Overview

Textbook-Hunt is a meteor application providing UH students with a market of used textbooks. When you arrive at the site the first thing you meet is the landing page. 

A UH student can log in with their UH account and create a profile in which they can post offers to sell a textbook. As a seller, you can list the different textbooks you are selling by listing the following: name of the textbook, subject department, conditions of the book (Excellent, Good, Okay, etc.), price, and additional comments about the book and the seller.

As a consumer, you can search by textbook name or subject department. Textbook-Hunt will provide a filter page for consumers to filter by condition, department, and/or by price. 

A consumer can then arrange with the seller for a payment plan and pick up a textbook. 

## Mockup Pages
